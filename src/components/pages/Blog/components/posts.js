          Ok, so my dear wife, K, needed US stocks prices to be added to her
          option trading log, which she runs on Google Sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          K, after a hard trading day, copy-pastes her option combos, strangles
          and whatnot data to Sheets from Interactive Brokers' TWS.
          Unfortunately, option trade data does not come with precise price of
          the underlying at the moment of option trade's execution.

        <p>
          It would be handy to know how much AMD traded for at 11:43:35 on
          November 19, 2020, right? Ok, maybe we aren't that fastidious, and can
          round time to 11:43.

          If so, then the easiest way to get stock prices is to use YahooPrices
          API. ...of which no documentation in human-readable format exists...

          Ran Aroussi published a nice Python module - yfinance. Many thanks,
          Ran! We are going to use this module to set up our simple Yahoo Prices
          API on Heroku.

          Ah yes, it all comes back to me now - the last feature that I added
          was to allow for all prices from the query to be returned as part of
          the response. Then users could sort themselves out should the main
          timestamp not be available. I did it by adding a new route:
        </div>
        <div className="pb--2rem">
          <Code block>
            <strong>POST</strong> https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com/allPrices

        </div>

        <div className="pb--1rem">
          But in so doing, I forgot to set a default value to the new argument
        </div>
        <div className="pb--1rem">
          <Code block>attach_prices=False</Code>
        </div>
        <div className="pb--1rem">
          of the underlying function that handles data requests for both routes.
          I should have done like this:
        </div>
        <div className="pb--1rem">
          <Code block>
            {`# yahoo.py

        <h3>Mein Workflow</h3>
        <p>
          Sorry for the title, couldn't resist. I do struggle with keeping my
          coding organised - not least because I haven't really coded as part of
          any large team with strict coding practices/guidelines. So my projects
          are fair game for me - I can touch any part of it whenever I want.
        </p>

        <p>
          Which more often than not creates a lot of unnecessary code
          re-writing. Or, even more often, after I wrote something I realise
          that it logically belongs to another branch.
        </p>

        <div className="pb--1rem">If there is no other branch, I simply</div>
        <div className="pb--2rem">
          <Code block>
            {`$ git checkout -b newBranch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "stuff that should be on newBranch"`}
          </Code>
        </div>

        <div className="pb--1rem">
          If there IS the other branch that logically owns the changes, no
          biggie, <Code>git stash</Code> to the rescue!
        </div>
        <div className="pb--2rem">
          <Code block>
            {`$ git stash     // all changes on current branch are 
                // reverted, equals to git reset --hard
$ git checkout anotherBranch
$ git stash pop // there might be some conflicts for manual resolution, 
                // I accept all incoming (stashed) changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "stuff that should have been on anotherBranch"`}
          </Code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Voila! Now we have appropriately positioned and accounted for our
          code.

          <strong>TL/DR: </strong>Transition between hoarding behaviour and open
          source (in my case vs private Bitbucket and public GitHub) - takes a
          mindshift. The question boils down to: Do I want to be a better
          developer/coder/programmer/professional? If the answer is YES - go
          public. If the answer is NO - stick with a private repo.
        </p>

        <h3>Public vs Private</h3>
        <p>
          Since the beginning of my coding hobby, in 2012, I was under the
          impression that what I code matters. Not that I would be able to put
          my finger on how exactly it mattered or why. Or why I was so sure that
          anyone would ever spend any of their valuable time
          reading/stealing/using my precious code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uploading my work to a public place changes how I think about the
          quality of my work. I have three rules:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>To push is better than to hoard.</strong> Pushing to main
              branch forces me to focus on solving an issue within the
              restricted timespan (I like those green commits, I do). But at the
              same time I realise I don't want to push garbage, so a this
              becomes a battle against <strong>Unrelenting Standards</strong>{" "}
              (ie "it's better now and imperfect that perfect and never").
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>To write documentation is better than write code.</strong>{" "}
              I want my work to be something that I am not ashamed of. The only
              sure way to get there for me is to incrementally improve my code
              (logic, organization, comments). Since "incrementally" means "step
              by step over time" - I ran into the old{" "}
              <strong>WHAT_THE_HELL_IS_THIS_DOING_HERE</strong> problem. When it
              takes me more time to remember what I was trying to achieve than
              actually incrementing the quality. Hence I make myself spend time
              on adding code comments, documentation, and notes. And if I'm
              completely honest, the benefit that I get when I actually think of
              what I am trying to achive via code far outweighs the benefits of
              having banged out some code for the sake of code lines (what?).{" "}
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>To compete is better that to delude yourself.</strong>{" "}
              This is the big one for me. I think open source allows ideas to
              compete. Even if they compete only within my own head, because,
              let's get real for a sec, no one is going to go through my repos
              with any level of attention. If they do, I'd be chaffed to bits to
              listen to their comments (after a couple of deep breaths that is).
              Hoarding code in my drawer kills any opportunity for it to be
              grown into something usable by actual humans. Pushing it out there
              in the public gives it at least a chance (however small). There is
              lots of work to do after just simple <Code>git push</Code> but
              without the first step, there won't be any others.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Pushing code to a public repo (and do remove all PID - privately
          identifiable data from your repo) vs hoarding all in a private repo
          gives you a chance and a stimulus to improve your work.
