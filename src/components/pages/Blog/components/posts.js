          Ok, so my dear wife, K, needed US stocks prices to be added to her
          option trading log, which she runs on Google Sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          K, after a hard trading day, copy-pastes her option combos, strangles
          and whatnot data to Sheets from Interactive Brokers' TWS.
          Unfortunately, option trade data does not come with precise price of
          the underlying at the moment of option trade's execution.
        </p>
        <p>Let's say she has this record:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            AMD ??? 19/11/2020 11:43:35 BTO LONG CALL +3 AMD NOV27'20 93 CALL
            0.57 3.59
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          It would be handy to know how much AMD traded for at 11:43:35 on
          November 19, 2020, right? Ok, maybe we aren't that fastidious, and can
          round time to 11:43.
        </p>
        <p>
          If so, then the easiest way to get stock prices is to use YahooPrices
          API. ...of which no documentation in human-readable format exists...
        </p>
        <p>
          Ran Aroussi published a nice Python module - yfinance. Many thanks,
          Ran! We are going to use this module to set up our simple Yahoo Prices
          API on Heroku.
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial logic was to:
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>launch a Python Yahoo Prices API on Heroku,</li>
              <li>call it from the Sheets and</li>
              <li>
                automatically update K's trading logs with underlying prices.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          I did the first step - which is now accessible on{" "}
          <a href="https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>. To use it -
          simply POST a JSON as follows:
          <pre>
            <code>{`{ "data": Ticker[] }`}</code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Where each Ticker is a list of:
          <pre>
            <code>
              {`[
    ticker: str, 
    # price may be skipped for POST request, add null in Postman
    price: null, 
    # at the moment of writing this post, it's hard to remember
    # why I split time into two lists like this.         
    [
      year:int, 
      month:int, 
      day:int
    ], 
    [
      hour:int, 
      min:int, 
      sec:int
    ]
]`}
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          If it all goes right, Yahoo Prices API will add a
          <pre>
            <code>price: float</code>
          </pre>
          to each Ticker.
        </p>

          As I am writing this, a month has passed since I launched the stuff
          above, and I hardly can remember how things were arranged!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sending a POST request with Postman to{" "}
          <a href="https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a> with a proper
          JSON:
          <pre>
            <code>
              {`{ 
    "data": [
        ["AMD", null, [2022, 3, 10], [15, 0, 0]]
    ]
}`}
            </code>
          </pre>
          But get a{" "}
          <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/500-internal-server-error-explained-2622938">
            500 Internal Server Error
          </a>{" "}
          response, which is üò¨
        </p>
        <p className="pt--1rem">

        <p>
          It all comes back to me now - the last feature that I added was to
          allow for all prices from the query to be returned as part of the
          response. So that users could sort themselves out should the main
          timestamp not be available. I did it by adding a new route:
          <pre>
            <code>
              <strong>POST</strong> https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com/allPrices
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          But in so doing, I forgot to set a default value to the new argument
          <pre>
            <code>attach_prices=False</code>
          </pre>
          of the underlying function that handles data requests for both routes.
          I should have done like this:
          <pre>
            <code>
              {`# yahoo.py 
def get_prices(tickers, attach_prices=False): ...`}
            </code>
          </pre>
          Now, when users call the old route:
          <pre>
            <code>
              <strong>POST</strong> https://yahooprices.herokuapp.com/
            </code>
          </pre>
          they get
          <pre>
            <code>
              {`{
    "data": [
        [

        <h3>
          Mein Workflow
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sorry for the title, couldn't resist. I do struggle with keeping my coding organised - not least because I haven't really coded as part of any large team with strict coding practices/guidelines. So my projects are fair game for me - I can touch any part of it whenever I want. 
        </p>

        <p>Which more often than not creates a lot of unnecessary code re-writing. Or, even more often, after I wrote something I realise that it logically belongs to another branch.</p>

        <p>If there is no other branch, I simply </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
            {`$ git checkout -b newBranch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "stuff that should be on newBranch"`}
            </code>
          </pre> 
        

        <p>If there IS the other branch that logically owns the changes, no biggie, <code>git stash</code> to the rescue!  </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
            
            {`$ git stash     // all changes on current branch are 
                // reverted, equals to git reset --hard
$ git checkout anotherBranch
$ git stash pop // there might be some conflicts for manual resolution, 
                // I accept all incoming (stashed) changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "stuff that should have been on anotherBranch"`}
            </code>
          </pre> 
        
        <p>
        Voila!

Now we have appropriately positioned and accounted for our code.

        <strong>TL/DR: </strong>Transition between hoarding behaviour and open source (in my case vs private Bitbucket and public GitHub) - takes a mindshift. The question boils down to: Do I want to be a better developer/coder/programmer/professional? If the answer is YES - go public. If the answer is NO - stick with a private repo.
        </p>

        <h3>Public vs Private</h3>
        <p>Since the beginning of my coding hobby, in 2012, I was under the impression that what I code matters.
          Not that I would be able to put my finger on how exactly it mattered or why. Or why I was so sure that anyone would ever spend any of their valuable time reading/stealing/using my precious code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Uploading my work to a public place changes how I think about the quality of my work. I have three rules: 
          <ol>
            
            <li><strong>To push is better than to hoard.</strong> Pushing to main branch forces me to focus on solving an issue within the restricted timespan (I like those green commits, I do). But at the same time I realise I don't want to push garbage, so a this becomes a battle against <strong>Unrelenting Standards</strong> (ie "it's better now and imperfect that perfect and never").</li>
            
            <li><strong>To write documentation is better than write code.</strong> I want my work to be something that I am not ashamed of. The only sure way to get there for me is to incrementally improve my code (logic, organization, comments). Since "incrementally" means "step by step over time" - I ran into the old <strong>WHAT_THE_HELL_IS_THIS_DOING_HERE</strong> problem. When it takes me more time to remember what I was trying to achieve than actually incrementing the quality. Hence I make myself spend time on adding code comments, documentation, and notes. And if I'm completely honest, the benefit that I get when I actually think of what I am trying to achive via code far outweighs the benefits of having  banged out some code for the sake of code lines (what?). </li>
            
            <li><strong>To compete is better that to delude yourself.</strong> This is the big one for me. I think open source allows ideas to compete. Even if they compete only within my own head, because, let's get real for a sec, no one is going to go through my repos with any level of attention. If they do, I'd be chaffed to bits to listen to their comments (after a couple of deep breaths that is). Hoarding code in my drawer kills any opportunity for it to be grown into something usable by actual humans. Pushing it out there in the public gives it at least a chance (however small). There is lots of work to do after just simple <code>git push</code> but without the first step, there won't be any others.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Pushing code to a public repo (and do remove all PID - privately identifiable data from your repo) vs hoarding all in a private repo gives you a chance and a stimulus to improve your work.
