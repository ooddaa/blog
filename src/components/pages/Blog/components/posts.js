          Ok, so my dear wife, K, needed US stocks prices to be added to her
          option trading log, which she runs on Google Sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          K, after a hard trading day, copy-pastes her option combos, strangles
          and whatnot data to Sheets from Interactive Brokers' TWS.
          Unfortunately, IB's option trade reports do not come with a precise
          price of the underlying at the moment of option trade's execution.

        <div className="pb--1rem">Let's say she has this record:</div>

          It would be handy to know how much AMD traded for at 11:43:35 on
          November 19, 2020, right? Ok, maybe we aren't that fastidious, and can

          If so, then the easiest way to get stock prices is to use YahooPrices

          Ran Aroussi published a nice Python module - yfinance. Many thanks,

          was to allow for all prices from the query to be returned as part of

          Sometimes I struggle with keeping my coding organised. My projects are

          Since the beginning of my coding hobby, in 2012, I was under the
          impression that what I code matters. Not that I would be able to put
          my finger on how exactly it mattered or why. Or why I was so sure that
          anyone would ever spend any of their valuable time

                This is the biggest one for me. I think open source allows ideas

              Hoarding code in my drawer kills any opportunity for it to be
              grown into something usable by actual humans. Pushing it out there
              in the public gives it at least a chance (however small). There is
              lots of work to do after just simple <Code>git push</Code> but
              without the first step, there won't be any others.

          Last time I used the <Code>useEffect</Code> hook, it was to initialize

        </div>
        <div className="pb--1rem">
          <Prism language="tsx">{`useEffect(() => {

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
    };
  }, [answerArr, task.product, isCorrectAnswer]);`}</Prism> */}
        </div>
        <div className="pb--1rem">
          Important detail is the empty array passed as the second argument.
          This sets the <Code>useEffect</Code> to fire only once per the
          Component's lifecycle. Namely - right after the Component has been
          rendered to the DOM.

          Yesterday, after ditching a bunch of useful code because I thought it

          on what kind of garbage code you are throwing away. If you are 100%
          sure it should perish, then <Code>git reset --hard</Code> and never
          look back. But what if you're wrong and you've just binned a code that
          might worth at least 50kcal ??
        </PB8>
        <H3>Let me share my example.</H3>
        <P pb={4}>
          Yesterday I helped my wife deploy her React project to{" "}
          <a
            className="hover:text-amber-600 underline decoration-solid"
            href="https://www.netlify.com"
          >
            Netlify
          </a>
          . The build was failing because by default Netlify's build
          configuration was set to treat React's warnings as errors. Two plans
          were obvious, I should either:
        </P>
        <PB8>
          <ol className="ml-4 list-decimal">
            <li className="mb-0">
              Correct the codebase - get rid of warnings; or
            </li>
            <li>Correct Netlify's config - make it ignore warnings.</li>
          </ol>
        </PB8>
        <H3>1. Dealing with warnings</H3>
        <PB8>
          As I wrote in my recent{" "}
          <Link to="/blog/setting-document-event-listeners-with-React-useEffect-hook">
            Setting document event listeners with React useEffect hook
          </Link>{" "}
          blogpost, I used a <Code>useEffect</Code> hooks to set up document
          listeners and React's linter warned me:
          <Center className="pt-4">
            <img
              className="rounded-lg"
              src="/img/missingDependency.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </Center>
        </PB8>
        <PB8>
          Naturally, I did not pay any attention to the warning, because:
          <Blockquote cite="Donald Knuth">
            Premature optimization is the root of all evil
          </Blockquote>
        </PB8>
        <PB8>
          That is until the moment when Netlify deployment was derailed off of
          these unhandled warnings.
        </PB8>
        <H3>Long story short</H3>
        <PB8>
          I managed to wrap everything in <Code>useCallback</Code> hooks or move
          function definitions inside useEffect hook so that its dependencies do
          not change on each render. As per the suggestion:
          <Center className="pt-4 pb-4">
            <img
              className="rounded-lg"
              src="/img/wrapInuseCallback.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </Center>
          It was a bit of struggle. But then I was all set - no warnings from
          compiler. Yas!
        </PB8>
        <PB8>
          <P pb={4}>
            The only problem was that in a previous commit I added a dependency
            to
          </P>
          <JS colorScheme="dark">{`/* init state */
  useEffect(() => {
    reset();
  }, []);`}</JS>
          <P pb={4}>Like this:</P>
          <JS colorScheme="dark">{`/* init state */
  useEffect(() => {
    reset();
  }, [reset]);`}</JS>
          Again, as per Create-react-app's suggestion:
          <Center className="pt-4 pb-4">
            <img
              className="rounded-lg"
              src="/img/addResetAsDependency.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </Center>
          Which went horribly wrong - the app just kept re-setting its state,
          because that's what <Code>reset()</Code> is for. But nevermind.
          Important thing here is that I missed the fact that I broke the app
          following compiler's advice and commited a bug. Then, after I wrangled
          all warnings and was ready to show Netlify who's the boss, I quickly
          peeked at whether the app was actually doing what it supposed to do.
          Which it wasn't.
        </PB8>
        <PB8>
          My quick panic reaction was that it must have been the current latest
          changes (a lot of wrangling with moving code/adding
          dependencies/wrapping in useCallbacks) that introduced the error. So I
          decided to discard all convoluted code wrangling and hit{" "}
          <Code>git reset --hard</Code>...
        </PB8>
        <PB8>
          ... only to discover that nope, that code was not the reason the bug
          existed. And yes, I{" "}
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#Documentation/git-reset.txt---hard">
            cannot
          </a>{" "}
          get it back.
        </PB8>
        <P pb={4}>What I should have done was to</P>
        <P pb={4}>
          <JS noCopy colorScheme="dark">{`$ git stash save wrangleDeps`}</JS>
        </P>

          which would've discarded all the changes in the current working tree
          anyways, <Bold>AND</Bold> I'd have access to the work I had done.
          Which turned out to be useful and not related to the bug that I
          caught. The sad part - now I need to do the wrangling again. But this
          time I'll

          Ok, I need to remove these new untracked files somehow. I really hoped{" "}
